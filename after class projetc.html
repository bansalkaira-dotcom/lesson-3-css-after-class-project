<h3>Cascading Style Sheets</h3>

<p id="id1"> CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a stylesheet language used to control the appearance and layout of web pages. While HTML
defines the structure and content of a page, CSS is responsible for how that content looks—such as colors, fonts,
spacing, alignment, and positioning. By separating design from content, CSS makes websites easier to maintain and
update. A single CSS file can style multiple web pages, ensuring consistency across a website and reducing repetitive
code.</p>
<p id="id2">CSS works by applying rules to HTML elements using selectors, properties, and values. It supports responsive design,
allowing web pages to adapt to different screen sizes like mobiles, tablets, and desktops through media queries. Modern
CSS also includes powerful features such as Flexbox and Grid for layout design, animations and transitions for
interactivity, and variables for better code management. Overall, CSS plays a crucial role in creating visually
appealing, user-friendly, and accessible websites.</p>
<p id="id3">CSS is essential for creating a smooth and engaging user experience on the web. It allows developers to control visual
hierarchy, readability, and navigation by adjusting elements like font size, contrast, margins, and whitespace. With
CSS, designers can implement themes, hover effects, and visual feedback that guide users naturally through a webpage.
This improves not only the look of a site but also its usability and accessibility for different users.

Another important advantage of CSS is performance and efficiency. By reusing styles and minimizing inline formatting,
CSS helps web pages load faster and remain lightweight. It also makes collaboration easier, as designers and developers
can work on styles independently from the content. As web standards evolve, CSS continues to grow with features like
dark mode support, custom properties, and advanced selectors, making it a powerful and flexible tool in modern web
development.</p>
